# Style Guide

Before submitting a commit make sure the code follows RERE's style guide:

* Use indentation as 2 spaces, not tabs.
* For JavaScript files use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#syntax) and camel case for variables and functions.
* Use snake case for Python files.
* Don't leave more than 2 break lines between code or at the end of the file.

Overall style concept is partly contained in (.editorconfig)[../.editorconfig] file.
In doubt or if not mentioned above reffer to (PEP 8)[https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/].
