## Running the simulator

There's no need to run separate python scripts now.

First, run the startup script and supply arduino port as the argument.
```
./run.sh 
```

Then browse to `localhost:5000`.


## Goals

* ~~every station has it's own table.~~ 
* dashboard (plots etc.)
* cleaner db and connection.
