# USB Debug

[Adafruit Feather M0](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-basic-proto/) and [RadioHead](https://github.com/jecrespo/RadioHead) is pretty difficult configuration. Instead of compiled code you have errors.  
Instead of doing the same things to resolve issues with M0 I tried to debug it myself and see what is wrong.
